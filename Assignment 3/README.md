## Assignment 3 – 
# Goal :
Incorporate Attribution modeling and Budget Optimization

# Aim :
1) Time-decay attribution: gives more credit to the touchpoints that are
closer in time to the conversion.
2) Linear attribution: gives equal credit to all touchpoints in the journey.
3) U-shaped attribution: gives most of the credit to the first and last
touchpoints, and some credit to intermediate touchpoints.
4) First-touch attribution: gives all credit to the first touchpoint in the
journey
5) Implementing each algorithm

# Themes considered in the dashboard are:
LTA , UTA , Regression,Time Decay , U Shape and Simulation

# Analysis performed on the datasets are:
Joining the datasets. • Filtering • Aggregation • Handling missing values • Deriving additional columns from existing datasets • Cleaning 

# Analysis performed on the Dashboard are:
• Predicting the findings on the dashboard for each algorithm and analyzing the best one.

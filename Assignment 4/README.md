# Goal :
## Incorporate Recommendation Systems using Surprise Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

### Aim :

4 stages to the built recommendation Systems:

## Quick Start(Setup the Environment) - 

This basically needs the environment setup to run the Jupyter Notebook and special packages and library need to build the Recommendation Systems
## Prepare the Data - 
Since SVD use Collaborative filtering for recommendation system the primary field we will need to do SVD on our data is Review/Rating entity 
## Built the Model - 
The algorithm we have implemented is the Surprise Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
The model is a collaborative filtering algorithm that can be used for training a matrix factorization model, which predicts explicit or implicit ratings of users on items for recommendations.

## Evaluate the Model - 
SVD algorithm was specifically designed to predict ratings as close as possible to their actual values. In particular, it is designed to have a very low RMSE


## Analysis performed on the datasets ( using Faker )are:
Joining the datasets. • Filtering • Aggregation • Handling missing values • Deriving additional columns from existing datasets • Cleaning
## Idea behind generated Dataset -
Generated Snack details by assigning Snack ID ,User ID and also observed the protein content

## Analysis performed on the Dashboard are:
• Predicting the findings on the dashboard for SVD algorithm and analyzing the RMSE.
